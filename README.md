## User story
As a movie enthusiast,
I want to search for movies to watch and create a schedule,
So that I can better organise my time to watch as many movies as possible!

## Usage 

The webpage allows you to search the OMDB database, click in the search bar and type in the movie you want to know more about. Click search, and watch as the page loads. Here you see info about the movie, and the trailer for the movie.
