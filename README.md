## Deployed page

## User story
As a movie enthusiast I want to know all about the movies I like. I want to search for movies to watch and save my favourites to a list, so I can better keep track of what to watch.

## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section. AKA list the API we are using?

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
