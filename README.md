## Deployed page
https://aywink.github.io/MovieZone/

## User story
As a movie enthusiast,
I want to search for movies to watch and create a schedule,
So that I can better organise my time to watch as many movies as possible!

## Usage 
The webpage allows you to search the OMDB database, click in the search bar and type in the movie you want to know more about. Click search, and watch as the page loads. Here you see info about the movie, and the trailer for the movie.

When the clock symbols is clicked in the top right corner of the information section, a modal appears and lets you save the movie to your schedule.

When you access the site from a mobile, the sections realign themselves as coloumns.
