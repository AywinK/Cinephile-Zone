## User story
As a movie enthusiast I want to know all about the movies I like. I want to search for movies to watch and save my favourites to a list, so I can better keep track of what to watch.

## Usage 

The webpage allows you to search the OMDB database

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```
